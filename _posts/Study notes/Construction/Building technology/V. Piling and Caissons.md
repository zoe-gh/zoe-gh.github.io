## Piling General

- Pile
	- Deep foundation
	- Driven to stable strata
	- Linked by pile cap
	- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220609110246.png" width="300" height="">

- Material: steel, reinforced concrete, sometimes timber
- Classification
	- End-bearing piles
		- Develop most friction at toe of pile
		- Bearing on a hard layer
	-	Friction (or floating) piles
		-	Shear stresses along the sides of pile
		-	Suitable where harder layers are too deep
- Types
	- Driven (or displacement) pile
		- Driven, jacked, vibrated or screwed into ground
		- Stable in soft soils
	- Bored pile
		- Remove soil to form a hole to form in-situ pile
		- Mininal vibration
		- Continuous light auger (CFA) pipe	
			- Boring and pouring takes place simultaneously
	- Screw pile
		- With a helix near the pile toe sot to be screwed into ground
	- Micropile
		- Small dismeter 100-250mm
		- Application
			- Shallow bedrock
			- Boulders and cavities
			- Immediate hard strata
			- Where underpinning is required
		- Construction practice
			- Drill down a high-strength steel casing to the dsign depth
			- Insert rebar and pump high-strength cement grout into casing
			- Casing may not extend along the full length of pile, but rebar will
			- Steeling casing may be removed
	- Pile wall
		- To create permanent or temporary retaining walls
		- Construction practice
			- Place piles adjacent to one another
		- Types
			- Contiguous pile wall
				- Gaps between piles can be sealed to create a watertight retaining wall
				- Application: Cellar or basement
			- Secant pile wall
				- Interlocking pile walls
				- Application: cost effective for shor-term water retention

			-	Tangent pile wall
				-	Similar to secant pile wall, but no pile overlap
			- Sheet pile wall
				- Made from sections of sheet materials with interlocking edges
			- Soldier pile and lagging wall
				- Embedded excavation support with vertical beams (soldiers) and horizontal lagging placed at interval
				- Material
					- Soldier pile: steel
					- Lagging: timber, precast concrete
	- Geothermal pile
		- Combine pile with ground-source heat pump system
		- Pile as heat exchanger
		- Construction practice
			- Pre-fabricated loops filled with heat transfer fluid
		- Not widely used

- Construction practice
	- Pile equipment
		- Percussion dirver: driven by stram, compressed air ot diesel
		- Hydraulic driver
		- Vibratory driver: vibrate piles into the ground
		- Rotary auger: screw replacement piles
	- Strutting and shoring
		- 11111111111111111111111111 TBC
	- Preboring
		- 11111111111111111111111111 TBC


## Steel Sheet Piling

- Sheet piles
	- Sheet with interlocking edges
	- Driven into the ground 
	- To provide earth retention and excavation support
	- Material: steel (mostly), timber, reinforced concrete

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220607150640.png" width="200" height="">

- Application
	- Retaining walls, land reclamation, underground structures
	- e.g. carpark, basement, riverbank protection, seawall
- Forms of steel sheet piles
	- Normal section - Larssen and Frodingham sheet piles

	- Straight web sections

		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220607155506.png" width="300" height="">

	- Box sections

		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220607160948.png" width="300" height="">

	- Composite sections

		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220607161048.png" width="300" height="">

- Construction practice
	- Method
		- Panel driving
			- Erect a panel inside a stiff template before driving the pipes
	
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220607161829.png" width="300" height="">

			- Application
				- For permanent walls
				- In soils where leaning is predicted
			- Advantages	
				- Easier to achieve required tolerances
			- Disadvantages
				- More time
				- Need longer crane boom
		- Panel driving combined with staggered driving
			- Staggering piles
			- Application
				- In compact soilds, reinforcing the tips of some piles improves the performance, every other pile is reinforced.
		- Pitch and drive
			- Pile is threaded and friven directly to final depth
