### Electric shock 
- Electric shock
	- Body forms part of a circuit in which current flows
		- Contract between two live components
		- Contact between a live component and earth
	- 0.1 ampere for 2 seconds can be fatal

### Earthing and bonding basics
- Earthing
	- Connect neutral conductor to earth by an earth electrode
	- Ensure the current flows to earth if touch a live component
		- Fault current passes the least resistance, the protective earth conductor
	- Some electrical equipment with additional insulation not required to be earthed
- Bonding
	- Conductive path between sub-station earth electrode and building conductive parts (e.g. pipes, sanitary)
	- Bonding conductor to link extraneous conductive parts and earthing terminal
	- Local supplementary bonding
		- Where there is an increased risk of electric shock
		- Damp encironment e.g. bathroom bathtub & basin
	- Bonding of incoming services
		- Metal service pipe entering building bonding to main service terminal
		- Also need to bond at the entry point so that eath fualts not affect other buildings
	- Earth clamp and warning label used in all connections to extraneous conductive parts

### Earthing arrangement

- TN-S system
	- Separate neural conductor and protective earth conductor
	- Metal sheath of the incoming supply cable provides the earth, connected directly to the building's main earthing terminal
	- Gradually replaced by TN-C-S system

- TN-C-S system (protective multuple earthing PME)
	- Outer conductor of the incoming supply cable as both neutral and earthing conductor
	- Widely used

- TT system
	- Incoming supply not incorporate an earthing conductor
	- Insert earth electrodes into the ground as an earth conductor
		- Material: steel, stainless steel, copper (suitable), cast iron
		- Shape: rods (widely used), strips, plastes, cables
