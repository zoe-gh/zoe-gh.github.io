## Circuit and Accessories

### Circuit

- Connection to distribution board
    - From excess current protection device (fuse or circuit breaker) in a distribution board
    - One fuse or CB serve several outlets
    - Final circuit: wiring from one fuse or CB
    - Size of fuse or CB
        - Determined by the number and type of outlets on the circuit
        - Maximum simultaneous load
            - Apply a diversity factor on sum of the maximum currents taken by all equipment
        - Norm: 13A socket and fused plug
- Cable in final circuit
    - 1.5mm2 for lighting
    - 2.5mm2 for opwer circuits to socket outlets
    - 6.0mm2 & 10mm2 for circuits to cookers, water heaters, and showers etc
- 



### Switch
- Components
    - Box
    - Front plate
- Classification
    - General-duty safety switch
        - For normal use in lighting and power circuits
    - Heavy duty HD
        - For frequent interruptting, high-fault currents
- Property
    - Throw to describe output, pole to describe input
    - Single-throw unless specified
    - Available in 1P to 5P
        - Pole: num of circuits that one switch can control for one operation
    - Fusible or nonfusible
    - Maximum current: 5, 6, 15, 20, 45A
- Contactor
    - A switch
        - Most by controlled by eletromagnet
        - Deenergized condition is normal state
        - Normally open (NO): open when deenergized
        - Normally closed (NC): closed when deenergized
    - Application: motor, light (high current)
    - Relay: an electrically opreated contactor
        - Application: small light, siren, indication lamp (lower current)
- Special switch
    - Remote-control switch
        - A contactor that latches mechanically
    - Automatic transfer switch
        - Switch to emergency service on failure of normal service
    - Time-controlled switch
    - Solid-state switch
        - Switch on extra voltage
    - Programmable switch

### Socket outlet

- A female socket connected to power wiring to accept the male plug of an appliance
- Component
    - Box
    - Front plate, usu. intergal with outlet
- Property
    - Maximum current: usu. 13A
    - 3 pins
        - Two for line and neutral cables
        - Third for a separate circuit protective conductor
    - With or without switch
    - With or without indicator light

### Fused connection/spur unit

- To connect a single permanently fixed appliance to the wiring
    - Same function as a socket and plug combination
- Property
    - With fuse accessible for replacement
    - With or without switch
    - With or without indicator light

### Junction box

- An enclosure housing electrical connections

### TV/telephone/data outlet

- Connector of TV/telephone/data device to wiring

### Lampholder and ceiling rose

-  Lampholder
    - Conenct the lamp to wiring
    - Support the weight of the holders, lamp and shade

## Connector

- Methods of joining wiring
    - Crimp wiring
        - By squeezing lugs onto the cable conductor
    - Connector block

## Enclosure

- Prevent from dirt and moisture
- International Protection code IPxx
    - First digit 0-6: protection against ingress of solids
    - Second digit 0.8: protection against ingess of liquids
    - Higher, better
