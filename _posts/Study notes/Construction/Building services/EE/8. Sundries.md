### Fire detection and alarm system

- Category
	- Automatic system intended for the protection of life
	- Manul system without automatic fire detector
	- Automatic system intended for the protection of property
- Addressable system
	- Receive and identify signals from each detector or call point
	- Addressable analogue system
		- Analogue signal
			- Output signal from each detector varies in proportion to the level of the smoke, heat or flame
			- Advantage
				- Give early indicaton of fire
				- Can be logged and automatically identified
				- Reduce false alarm
	- Control panel
		- Provide user interface
		- Usu. located near main entrance to the building
		- Function	
			- Monitor status of detectors and call points
			- Activate sounder in case of alarm; and silence
			- Indicate signal zone
			- Indicate faults of public address and detector
			- Indicate condition of backup power supply
	- Repeater panel
		- Sub-control panel for zone

- Zoning
	- For quickly indentify alarm location
- Detector
	- Linear heat detection cable
		- To detect changes in tempertur along the whole length of the installed cable
		- Application
			- Service tunnel, escalator, cable racking, warehouse storage system
	- Point detector
		- To detect smoke, flame, or changes in temperature within the vicinity of the detector
		- Type of detector
			- Fixed temperature heat detector
			- Rate-of-rise heat detector
			- Flame detector
			- Optical smoke detector
			- Ionisation samoke detector
			- Aspirating smoke detector
- Sounder
	-  Sounder line-testing
		- Integrity of the wiring that links the sounders is continuously monitored by the control panel
	- Voice evacuation system
	- Two-wire system
		- One circuit combines detector and sounder
		- Reduce installation cost
	- Tactile alarm system
		-	For impaied hearing
- Call points
	- Call point to trigger an alarm condition
	-	Manual call point: e.g. break glass unit
- Fire resistance cable
	- Mineral insulated cable (MICC)
	- Soft-skinned cable

### Security system

- Planning and operation of sercuity systems
	- Consideration
		- Building location and type
		- Business activities/hours of occupation
		- Size, transportability and value of contents
		- Availability of on-site sercurity personnel
	- Power supplies]
	- Battery back-up
- Intruder detection
	- Mechanical reed-switch
		- Protect doors, windows and openings
	- Megnetic contact switch
		- Protect doors and windows
	- Glass-break detector
		- Monitor glazing by sound detection
	- Photo-electric sensor
		- Infrared light detection
	- Motion sensor
		- Active motion senrosr
			- Microwave signal to detect disturbance caused by intruder
		- Passive motion sensor
			- Detect heat or noise
- Closed-circuit television (CCTV)

	- Camera
	- Monitor
	- Vidoe multiplexer
	- Video Recorder
- Access control
	- Stand-alone system
	- On-line system
	- Types of devices
		- Digital codes
		- Magnetic strip cards
		- Biometric access control
		- Proxomoty cards and tags

## Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)

- Function
	- Stable power supply
	- Prevent from power failure and poor power quality

## Photovoltaics (PV system)
- Types
    - Gird-connected
        - Solar system connected to the local electricity network
        - Inverter to convert DC power to AC power
    - Grid supported solar sustem
        - Solar system connected to the local electricity network and a back-up battery
    - Off grid solar system
        - Completely independent of the grid
        - Solar system connected to a battery
    - Hybrid system
        - Solar system combined with anther source of power
    - Flywheel system
        - Store energy in a rotating mass with low fraction los
