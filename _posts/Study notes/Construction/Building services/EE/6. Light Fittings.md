## Introduction to lighting

- Luminous flux - lumen (lm)
    - Quantity of light emitted by a lamp
- Luminous efficacy - (lm/W)
- Colour temperature - Kelvin (K)
    - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220624134600.png" width="450" height="">
- Colour rendering index (CRI)
    - Ability of light to reveal the real color of objects
    - CRI 0-100, should be at least 80
- Illuminance - lumen/m2 (lux)
    - Amount of light reaching a surface
- Gare
    - Discomfort glare
        - Unified Glare Rating (UGR)
    - Control

## Luminaires

- With Display screens

## Lighting system

- General lighting system
    - Provide a uniform illuminance
- Local lighting system
    - Provide basic ambient illuminance with luminaires located at workstations to provide task illuminance
    - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220624142534.png" width="300" height="">
- Localised lighting system
    - Luminaires located in close proximity to the workstations to provide task illuminance
    - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220624142544.png" width="300" height="">

## Lighting control

- Manual switch
- Electronic lighting control system
    - Presence detection
    - Daylight sensing
    - Time control
    - Illumination control

## Emergency lighting

- Function of escape lighting
    - Indicate escape routes and provide illumination
    - Indicate fire alarm call points and fire fighting equipment
    - Permit safety operations
- Minimum illuminance level of emergency lighting
- Types
    - Maintained emergency luminaires
        - Connect to a conventional power supply and an emergency supply
        - Always in operation

        - Powered by an emergency power supply
        - Only operation when failure of conventional supply
    - Self-contained emergency luminaires
        - With own battery for stand-alone operation instead of a central emergency power supply
    - Conversion kit
        - Allow general lighting to be adapted for use as both normal and emergency luminaires
    - Central battery system
