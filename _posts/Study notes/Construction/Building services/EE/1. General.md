### Unit

- Ampere (amp) (A)
	- Unit of electric current
	- Measure the velocity of flow
- Volt (V)
	- Unit of electric potential
	- Measure the pressure of pump
- Ohm (Ω)
	- Unit of electric resistance
	- Resistance for DC circuit, impedance (Z) for AC circuit
	- Conductor
		- Material with less resistance
		- silver, gold, platinum, copper, aluminum
	- Insulator
		- Material with more resistance
		- glass, mica, rubber, oil, distilled water, porcelain
	- Resistance changes with temperature

### Ohm's law

- V = I x R

### Current arrangement

- Series circuit
	- Elements are connected one after another
	- Current is the same, resistances and voltages add

- Parallel circuit
	- Two or more branches are connected in parallel
	- Voltage is the same, currents add

### Direct current and alternating current

- Alternating current (AC)
	- Flow changes its direction periodically
	- Commonly used for household equipment, buildings
	- One cycle: a positive and a negative AC loop
	- Frequency (hertz Hz): number of cycles in 1 second
		- HK 50Hz

- Direct current (DC)
	- Flow does not change periodically
	- Single direction in a steady voltage
	- e.g. electrical devices, batteries, all with an AC adapter

### Power and energy

- Energy (work) = power x time
- Unit of energy: Btu (calories), kilowatt-hours (kWh)
- Unit of time: horsepower, Btu per hour, kilowatt
- W = I^2 x R = I (IR)
	- For AC: W = VI x pf
		- pf: power factor, efficiency
			- Reactance in AC causes a phase difference between voltage and current
		- In purely resistive circuit: pf = 1, wattage equals volt-amperage

### Electric utility service

- Service from a utility line to a building
	- Considerations
		- Length of the service run
		- Terrain and weather
		- Cost
		- Service voltage
		- Size and number of eletric load
		- Importance of apperance
		- Local practice and ordinances
		- Maintenance and service reliabiity
	- Overhead service
		- Advantages
			- Cost saving 10%-50%
			- Easily maintained
		- Not preferred in heavy loading areas with server weather conditions
		- Types
			- Bare for high-voltage lines (2.4 kV and higher)
			- Weatherproof with one conductor (1/c) for low-voltage circuits (600V and below)
			- Preassembled aerial cable with 3-4 cables for up to 15 kV
	- Underground service
		- Advantages
			- Appearance
			- Service reliability and durability
		- Wiring method
			- Direct burial
				- No piping to protect
				- Reduce cost but hard for maintenance
			- Concrete-encased duct
				- High strength and performance
				- High cost
				- Use of nonmetallic conduit with encasement
			- Direct burial duct
				- Little strength
				- Median cost

- Service equipment
	- Transformer
		- Transform AC voltage to anther AC voltage
		- Reversible: step-down or step-up
			- High/primary voltage to low/secondary voltage
		- Transformer power capacity: kilovolt-amperes (kVA)
			- In single phase:

		- Heat generated transferred to cooling medium
			- Air-cooled for low-voltage < 600V
			- Liquied-filled for high-voltage > 5kV
		- Types
			- Load center transformer
				- Install in unit substations indoor and outdoor
					- Indoor consider the temperation and ventilation
			- Distribution transformer
				- Mounted on a pole or on a concrete pad outdoors
		- Material
			- Organic, inorganic, silicon insulatant material
			- Insulation class affests operating temperature and size of transformer
			- Usually dry transformer for indoor

### Low and high voltage supplies to buildings

- Service equipment arrangements and metering
	- Metering
		- Ahead of the building service entrance switch
		- In the main switchboard or independently mounted
		- Furnished and installed by the utility conpany
		- Submetering
			- Banks of meter sockets are installed
		- Type
			- kWh meter
				- Only record useful work done, not considering power factor
			- kVA meter
				- Rrcord the used capacity of supply, unaffected by power factor
	- Main switch
		- Sometimes included in main distribution board by customer
		- Somtimes by utility

- Low voltage supplies to buildings
	- Single-phase supply
		- For domestic and small commercial building - 220V
		- Three phases supplied by the substation are divided
	- Three-phase supply
		- Three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency
		- For larger buildings - 400V
		- L1, L2, L3 in different color to serve different zones
			- Buildingd may be zoned by floor, each zone 220V
		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoe-gif/images/master/20220615174845.png" width="500" height="">
		- Advantages
			- Greater power density
			- Easier to balance loads

- High voltage supplies to buildings
	- For large commercial buildings and industrial installations with loads > 1000kVA
	- Usually 11kV
	- Cusumer responsible for sub-station, transformer, switchgear

### Power quality

- Spike
	- Momentary rapid change in voltage
	- Cause
		- Lightning strikes 
		- Electrical equipment that switch large currents

- Surge
	- Sustained voltage increase above the normal level
	- Cause
		- Sudden reductions in heavy plant loads

- Harmonics
	- Frequency created by non-linear electrical equipment
	- Affect electronic equipment & overheating of neutral conduction and electromagnetic equipment

- Sag
	- Brief drop in voltage
	- Casue
		- Switching of equipment that draws a heavy electrical load

- Brownout
	- Sustained drop in voltage

- Blackout
	- Total power failure

### Types of circuit fault

- Overcurrent fault
	- Current exceeds the maximum safe level
	- Cause
		- Connection of exceesive equipment to the circuit
		- Partial short-circuit

- Short-circuit fault
	- A phase conductor connects to anther phase or neutral

- Earth fault
	- A live conductor connect to earthed metalwork (exposed conductive parts or extraneous conductive parts)
