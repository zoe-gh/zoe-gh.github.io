### Fuse
- Fusible link (element) melt when overcurrent for sufficient time
- Cartridge duse: most common
	- Tinned copper or silver wire (element) mounted within a ceramic tube with brass end-caps

### Circuit breaker
- A mechanical switch
	- Can manually break circuit under normal operating loads
	- Can automatically break circuit under overcurrent
- Material for insulating medium
	- Air for low voltage circuit
	- Oil or vacuum for high voltage circuit
- Miniature circuit breaker (MCB)
	- Widely used in low voltage up to 100A
	- Thermo-magnetic type: common
		- Therm mechanism to protect against overcurrent
		- Magnetic mechanism to protect against short circuit
- Residual current device (RCD)
	- Break when detecting difference in current flow in live and neutral conductor
	- Provide supplementray protection
	- Residual current breaker with overload protection (RCBO)

### Distribution board
- House switchgear and circuit protection devices
- Max current rating of 800A

### IP rating
- Specifying the environmental protection afforded by enclosures
- IPxx
	- The first num - protection against solid objects
	- The second num - protection against liquids
	- The higher, the better protection
