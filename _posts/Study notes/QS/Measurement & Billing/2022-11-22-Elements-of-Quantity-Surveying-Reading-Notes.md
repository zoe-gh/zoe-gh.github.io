### General

- Two stages of BQ preparation
    - Taking off
        - Measurement of dimensions & compilation of the descriptions from drawings and spec
    - Billing
        - Squaring the dimensions and abstracting

- NRM
    - Published by RICS
    - Based on UK practice
    - 3 volumes
        - NRM1: order of cost estimating and elemental cost planing
        - NRM2: construction quantities and works procurement
        - NRM3: maintenance and operation cost planning and procurement

    - Col 3: squaring column
        - Products of dimensions
    - Col 4: description column
        - Sign-posting
            - Identify the location of dimensions
        - Waste calculation
            - Calculation the build-up of one of the dimensions

- Form of dimensions
    - Cubic measurements
    - Square or superficial measurements
    - Linear measurements
    - Enumerated items
    - Items

- Order of dimensions
    - Length -> Width -> Depth / Height

- NRM2 
    - Measurement
        - Net as fixed in position
        - Include all additional material required for laps, joints, seams and the like & wastage
        - Cuved work measured on the centre line
        - Dimensions rounded to nearest 10mm
        - Quantity rounded to nearest whole number
            - Exception: measured in tonnes rounded to two decimal places
        - Voids
            - Minimum deductions for voids refer only to openings or wants within the boundaries of the the measured work
            - Always deduct openings or wants at te boundaries of measured areas, irrespective of size
            - No separate measurement for widths not exceeding a stated limit where these widths are caused by voids
